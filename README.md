Coursework for University of Idaho, Fall 2023, ECE504

# Project 1: Transmission Line Neural Net
## Pre-requisites
Must have Pytorch installed to load the included model

## Feautures
Using a basic substrate (8mil dielectric, Dk/Df = 3.68/0.0087) this tool will calculate either of the following for a simple uncoated microstrip trace:
* Z0/Electrical Length from Trace Width and Trace Length (Analysis)
* Trace Width and Trace Length from Z0 and Electrical Length (Synthesis)

## Instructions
Simply run the Python file. It will prompt the user for input.
